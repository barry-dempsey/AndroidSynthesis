AndroidSynthesis
================

Android Synthesiser contains a class called SynGen which looks after the generation of synthetic sounds in the form of bleeps
and beeps through an assortment of Sine Waves, FM sweep and signal generators. Currently the build is specific to Android phone
handsets so I'm sharing this project, in its current state, with the aim to building it for Android tablets. 

To achieve this more music keys will need to be added plus my intention would be to implement some filtering in the app
to achieve subtractive type synthesis.

Thanks!
